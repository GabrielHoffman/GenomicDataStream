\title{Fit series of generalized linear models to multiple responses with shared design matrix}
\usage{
\S4method{glmFitResponses}{ANY}(
  Y,
  design,
  family,
  weights,
  offset,
  detail = 1,
  doCoxReid = nrow(design) < 100,
  nthreads = 1,
  chunkSize = 1000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{matrix of responses as __rows__}

\item{design}{design matrix}

\item{family}{family type of GLM: "gaussian", "logit", "probit", "poisson", "nb:x" where x is a numeric value of theta}

\item{weights}{vector of sample-level weights}

\item{offset}{vector of sample-level offset values}

\item{detail}{level of model detail returned, with LEAST = 0, LOW = 1, MEDIUM = 2, HIGH = 3, MOST = 4. LEAST (beta), LOW (beta, se, sigSq, rdf), MEDIUM (vcov), HIGH (residuals), MOST (hatvalues)}

\item{doCoxReid}{use Cox-Reid adjustment when estimating overdispersion for negative binomial models.  Default TRUE for less than 100 samples}

\item{nthreads}{number of threads.  Each model is fit in serial, analysis is parallelized across responses.}

\item{chunkSize}{number of features to read per chunk}

\item{...}{other args}
}
\value{
List of parameter estimates with entries \code{coef},  \code{se}, \code{sigSq}, \code{rdf} and other depending on \code{detail}
}
\description{
Fit regression model \code{Y[j,] ~ X} for each feature j
}
\examples{
library(DelayedArray)
n <- 100
m <- 5
nc <- 2
set.seed(1)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(n * m), m, n)
Y <- DelayedArray(Y)
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * nc), n, nc)
rownames(Y) <- seq(m)

# fit regressions with model j using Y[j,] as a response
fit <- glmFitResponses(Y, X, "gaussian")

# examine results
