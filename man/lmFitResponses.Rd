\title{Fit series of linear regression models to multiple responses with shared design matrix}
\usage{
\S4method{lmFitResponses}{ANY}(Y, design, Weights, detail = 0, nthreads = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{matrix of responses as __rows__}

\item{design}{design matrix}

\item{Weights}{matrix sample-level weights the same dimension as Y}

\item{detail}{level of model detail returned, with LOW = 0, MEDIUM = 1, HIGH = 2. LOW (\code{beta}, \code{se}, \code{sigSq}, \code{rdf}), MEDIUM (\code{vcov}), HIGH (\code{residuals}), MOST (\code{hatvalues})}

\item{nthreads}{number of threads.  Each model is fit in serial, analysis is parallelized across responses.}

\item{...}{other args}
}
\value{
List of parameter estimates with entries \code{coef},  \code{se}, \code{sigSq}, \code{rdf} and other depending on \code{detail}
}
\description{
Fit regression model \code{Y[j,] ~ X} for each feature j
}
\details{
Since the weights vary for each response, each model is computed separately without recycling precomputed values
}
\examples{
library(DelayedArray)
n <- 100
m <- 5
nc <- 2
set.seed(1)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(n * m), m, n)
Y <- DelayedArray(Y)
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * nc), n, nc)
rownames(Y) <- seq(m)
W <- matrix(runif(n * m), m, n)

# fit regressions with model j using Y[j,] as a response
fit <- lmFitResponses(Y, X, W)
#
# examine results
lapply(fit, head, 2)
